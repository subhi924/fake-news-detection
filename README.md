# fake-news-detection
Perfect 👍 You’re building a **Fake News Detection project**. A `README.md` should explain what the project does, how to set it up, how it works, and how to use it.

Here’s a good **README file** for your project:

# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Fake News Detection system** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.
It classifies news articles as **Fake (0)** or **Real (1)** based on their content.

We use:

* **NLTK** for text preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming).
* **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for feature extraction.
* **Logistic Regression** for classification.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* Pandas & NumPy → Data Handling
* NLTK → Text Preprocessing
* Scikit-learn → ML Model & Evaluation

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset should have at least:

* `title` → Headline of the article
* `text` / `content` → Main article content
* `label` → Target variable (0 = Fake, 1 = Real)

Example:

| title                   | content                            | label |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----- |
| Breaking News ...       | Some fake news article text ...    | 0     |
| Government announces... | Authentic news article content ... | 1     |

## 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
```

Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps

1. Remove non-alphabetic characters.
2. Convert text to lowercase.
3. Remove stopwords (using NLTK).
4. Apply stemming (Porter Stemmer).
5. Convert text to **TF-IDF vectors**.

## 📊 Model Training

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(news_df['content'])
y = news_df['label']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=1)

# Model training
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluation
print("Train Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_train, model.predict(X_train)))
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))
```

---

## 📈 Results

* Training Accuracy: ~97%
* Testing Accuracy: ~93%

*(Results may vary depending on dataset and preprocessing.)*

---

## 🖥️ Usage

To predict if a new article is fake or real:

```python
news = ["Breaking: Something big happened in politics today..."]
vectorized_news = vectorizer.transform(news)
prediction = model.predict(vectorized_news)

if prediction[0] == 0:
    print("Fake News ❌")
else:
    print("Real News ✅")
```

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Try **LSTM / BERT** for deep learning-based detection.
* Deploy using **Flask / FastAPI** for real-time detection.
* Build a simple **web UI** with Streamlit.
